# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

Hi, I'm Ncumisa! I have an analytical background in Biochemistry and currently, I am an entry level data analyst. I have developed a strong foundation in science and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data analysis as an entry-level data specialist.

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.


This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
